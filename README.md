# Deep Learning Final Project: Deep learning Approach for Question and Answering (QA) Systems

This project was done as the final project for the course Introduction to Deep Learning (ECE 685) at Duke University. This project was done by Ashwini Marathe and Srishti Saha

## QA Systems
Question answering systems enable users to retrieve exact answers for questions posed in natural language. They automatically answer questions asked by humans in natural language by referring to either a pre-structured database or a collection of documents/text-pieces written in a natural language.

Question answering (QA) is a complex natural language processing (NLP) task. It requires an understanding of the meaning of a text piece (story) along with the ability to reason over relevant facts contained within the leading stories. It then employs a model that can answer questions based on logic, reasoning and even understanding of natural language.

## Data
For building all the models in this report, we use the data from the Facebook bAbI project. bAbI is a carefully-designed set of 20 QA tasks. Each of these tasks consist of several context-question answer triplets, prepared and released by Facebook. Each task tests a different skill that a question answering model should have. The bAbI dataset comprises of synthetically generated stories about activity in a simulated world.

## Models

In this project, we are building models to develop the Question Answering framework. 1 We are building and evaluating several models for this purpose: (i) N-gram classifier (ii) LSTM (Long Short-term Memory) (iii) End-to-end Memory networks (iv) Seq2Seq (sequence-to-sequence) model (v) LSTM + attention
